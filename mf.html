					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>The Challenge</h3>
							<p>
								As social media has grown to become a cornerstone of everyday life in the 21st century, it has provided a major platform for users to not only socially interact with each other, but also keep them connected and up to date with the world around them.
							</p>


							<p>
								The false news epidemic in social media severely hinders people’s access to authentic information since around 67% of the U.S. adults get news from online media and 57% distrust that information. (PEW Research 2018)
							</p>
							<hr/>
						</div>

						<div class="text-width">
							<h3>Impact of misinformation or fake news</h3>
								<p>
									These inaccurately reported news, otherwise known as “false news”, have become an epidemic in recent times which have had enormous consequences in social, political and economic spheres of society. The incidents of false news centering the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and the Brexit movement in the U.K. prove how various interest groups can utilize social media platforms for their personal gain. Examples of this include the false news business ran by a Macedonian youth group (Tandoc & Ling, 2018), allegations of the use of Facebook for political gain during the 2016 U.S. election (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2018), and anti-refugee false news and hate crimes in Germany (Muller & Schwarz, 2018), all of which impacted society significantly.
								</p>
								<hr/>
							</div>

							<div class="text-width">
								<h3>Refined Problem Statement</h3>
									<p>
										Identifying and reporting potential <strong>viral</strong> fake information using social computing conceptual models since existing mechanisms are not effective due to the large volume of data and fast diffusion of false news.
									</p>
								</div>

				<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">User Research</span></h2></div>
					<div class="text-width">
						<h3>User Interviews</h3>
						<p>
						We interviewed a total of 22 users.
						</p>

						<section class="columns">

							<div class="column">
								<h1>5</h1>
								<p>Active Users </p>
							</div>

							<div class="column">
								<h1>3</h1>
								<p> Domain Experts </p>
							</div>


					</section>
						<p><strong>A few findings from the interviews</strong>
							<blockquote>"I didn't even realize that that my Apple Watch helps me wake up on time"</blockquote>
							<blockquote> Where the user keeps his waking up device (alarm, phone) has emerged as a big factor in deciding the waking up experience. </blockquote>
							<blockquote> People who have a certain goal in the morning, they wake up fresh to achieve that and they are on the constant lookout for incentives and motivation to wake up. </blockquote>
							<blockquote> People are able to successfully lie to themselves about sleeping for <strong>5 more minutes</strong> always and regret it later. </blockquote></p> <p><br></p>
					</div>


					<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">Research Synthesis</span></h2></div>
					<div class="text-width"><h3>Insights from Contextual Enquiry</h3>
						<p>From our primary research from Twitter users, and our secondary research from scholarly articles on false news, we have identified several key findings of this problem space:</p>


						<p></p>

					</div>
					<section class="columns">

						<div class="column">
							<h3>False news is highly reactive to real-world events</h3>
							<p>The propagation of false news is often fueled by political, religious, racial, and financial motives, and frequently becomes abundant during major events such as elections, social movements, and violent incidents</p>
						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h3>Individuals on social media regularly encounter false news</h3>
							<p>It has been very easy for false news to spread unchecked in high quantities, and organizational measures to control it is limited and imperfect. As individuals become more aware of this, they must employ their own strategies to identify and avoid misinformation.</p>
						</div>

					</section>

					<section class="columns">

						<div class="column">
							<h3>False news has a negative societal impact</h3>
							<p>The saturation of false news makes people powerless to access authentic information and lead to the discrediting of legitimate news reporting. Various groups disseminate misinformation to influence people’s perception of their views and ideologies which could mislead an entire nation or society.</p>
						</div>

						<div class="column">
							<h3>Designing solutions for false news is an ongoing challenge</h3>
							<p>Initiatives like Facebook’s flagging options in doubtful contents (Morgan, 2018); changing algorithms (Allcott et al., 2018); detecting bots (Laser et al., 2018); human fact-checkers (Temming, 2018) and Twitter’s rumor debunking algorithms (Liu et al., 2015), all brought a little to no effective solutions to the problem because none of these steps is individually effective.
</p>

						<h3>User Persona</h3>
				<div class="post-image">
						<img class="img-border"  src="images/mf/mf-persona.png">
				</div>
			</div>



			<div class="text-width">
						<h3>Key User Requirements</h3>
				<p>In coming up with a design to address this issue while also taking the previous challenges in consideration, we outline three key requirements:</p>
				<p><li>Identify false news and display feedback showing the user the degree in which a piece of information is true/accurate or how much bias is in it (like in a spectrum).</li></p>
				<p><li>Implement preventative measures to curb the spread of false news.</li></p>
				<p><li>Acknowledge previously failed implementations for controlling false news, either working around or building upon them.</li></p>

				<p></p>
			</div>

			<div class="text-width"><hr/></div>
			<div class="text-width">
						<h3>How should we respond?</h3>
				<p>Our primary research suggests a human-machine collaborative approach (an infrastructure enabled by both machine-driven and human fact-checking and an automated glossary of fake/hate/extremists terms) will work best to counter this persistent problem. Also due to the vastness of the problem we decided to focus on the portential <i>virality</i> of a post to mitigate impacts.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">Ideation and Solutions</span></h2></div>
			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
				<p>Combining crowdsourced fact-checking, algorithms, and machine learning to identify false news. Once a viral post hits a certain benchmark of flags, the fact-checking systems are enacted. If the article is concluded to be fake, it registers that article as false news which is explicitly stated to users. </p>
				<div class="post-image">
						<img class="img-border" src="images/mf/mf-story1.jpg">
						<i>In a conversation between two friends, where one of them brings up a questionable news article. One friend exclaims that the article is fake, and explains to his friend by showing him the truth finder’s evaluation of the article.</i> <hr/>
				</div>
				<div class="post-image">
						<img class="img-border" src="images/mf/mf-story2.jpg">
						<i>The user sees a news article posted by an account with malicious content and multiple users report it which triggers the fact-checking engine which checks for the credibility if the information and the reliability of the user account. </i> <hr/>
				</div>
			</div>


			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
				<p>Using Twitter as a medium as other social media platforms do not have flexible APIs to mine data easily.</p>
				<p>Identify false news and display feedback to the user while also facilitating social computing with crowdsourced participation. </p>
				<p>Implement preventative measures to curb the spread of false news. </p>
				<p>Acknowledge previously ineffective implementations for controlling false news, either working around or building upon them. </p> <br>
			</div>




			<div class="text-width">
				<h3>Design Solution</h3>
				<p>Human-Machine-Human Collaborated fact-checker engine implemented as a Twitter Client, the <strong>TwitterTruth</strong>. Crowdsourced & AI fact-checking of posts & linked articles. Re-check critical information using a human fact-checker and display feedback for users. </p> <br>

				<h3>Implementation Feasability</h3>
				<p><strong>Social feasibility</strong>
						<li>Twitter is among the top 3 social media sites used for news
						<li>6 million users had installed third-party Twitter clients as of July 2018</li> <br>

						<strong>Technological feasibility</strong>
							<li>Revenue-sharing partnership with news sentiment categorization startup AdVerif.ai </li>
							<li>No limitation of vast volume of false news -> target the biggest posts that go viral </li> <br>

				<strong>Economic feasibility</strong>
				<li>Consumer spending on apps expected to grow 23% in the next 5 years</li>
				<li>Hook & bait strategy - $1.99 monthly fee starting with 3 month free trial</li>


				 </p> <br>

			</div>

			<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">Testing and Evaluation</span></h2></div>
			<div class="text-width">
						<h3>Usability Tests</h3>
						<p>During our product evaluations, we conducted 4 sessions with users to evaluate two main tasks detailing the main features of our app while doing a think-aloud protocol. These two tasks were:
							<li>I want to view, flag, and find the truth evaluation of a news post on Twitter.</li>
							<li>I want to find out more about a user using his profile to find potential bot accounts.</li>
						</p>

						<p>For each task, metrics were collected on time-on-task and task success. After each task was completed, two Likert-scale user reflection questions were asked:
							<li>How easy was this task, on a scale of 1 to 5? (1 being easiest and 5 being hardest)</li>
							<li>How useful was the app feature for this task, on a scale of 1 to 5? (1 being most useful and 5 being least useful)</li>
						</p>

						<p></p>

					</div>

			<div class="text-width"><hr/></div>
					 <div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Recommendations
						</h3>
						<p>From our evaluations, it is clear that the first recommendation is that our app would be in need of stronger ‘help’ and navigation features so that first-time users can more easily learn how to use the app, what functions it is meant to do, and how it differs from standard Twitter.
						</p>
						 <p>
 						 More recommendations from participants were suggested in making the app more rich in features.
						 </p>
						<p>
							One key recommendation which we got from our presentation feedback was the need for expert human fact-checkers in the evaluation process. This is because the crowdsourced flagging and machine AI evaluation may not be enough to give the user a substantial evaluation on whether or not a news post is truthful.
						</p>
						<br>

					<div class="text-width"><h2><span class="head-style">Reflection</span></h2></div>
					 <div class="text-width">
						<h3>
							Reflections
						</h3>
						<p>This project was an eye-opener and helped us understand the problems around fast pacing and ever-changing technology. This got me thinking as to how to design for something which is so transient? I am still trying to figure out this challenge as my other designers in the field. If given an opportunity, more time and resources I would like to test this solution with more users and even try and collaborate with domain experts to implement a early stage solution. .</p>
